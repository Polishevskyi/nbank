Docker image - a template for a future docker container (as a class for an object)
Docker container - a running container based on the docker image template (as an object for a class)

Steps:
0) Form a manual algorithm to run tests and report
1) Create a docker image based on tests (template)
2) Run tests based on the docker image inside the docker container
3) Get report on test results from the docker container
4) Put the result into a special result folder

Why? Use case

QA1 -> develop tests (all tech: java, mvn, etc.)
QA2 -> develop tests (all tech: java, mvn, etc.)
DEV1 -> just run a test (without understanding the tech)
DEV2 -> just run a test (without understanding the tech).

QA1 -> package new version of tests into a "box" (docker)
QA2 -> package new version of tests into a "box" (docker)

DEV1 -> take and run updated tests from "box" (using docker)
DEV2 -> take and run updated tests from "box" (using docker)
